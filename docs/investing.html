<p><strong>Earnings Per Share (EPS)</strong> is a company’s net profit
divided by the number of common shares it has outstanding. The resulting
number serves as an indicator of a company’s profitability. EPS
indicates how much money a company makes for each share of its stock and
is a widely used metric for estimating corporate value. A higher EPS
indicates greater value because investors will pay more for a company’s
shares if they think the company has higher profits relative to its
share price.</p>

<p><strong>Dividends</strong> are the distribution of corporate earnings
to eligible shareholders. They are often distributed quarterly and may
be paid out as cash or in the form of reinvestment in additional stock.
Common shareholders of dividend-paying companies are eligible to receive
a distribution as long as they own the stock before the ex-dividend
date. <strong>Dividend Yield</strong> is the amount paid per share
divided by the share price. Larger, established companies with
predictable profits are often the best dividend payers.</p>

<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>There is no strong correlation between the share price and dividend
yield or earnings. This means that a universal rule for determining
whether or not to invest into a stock does not exist. Instead,
investments should be determined on an individual basis formulated on a
company’s stability, potential, management, growth, and many other
considerable factors. The role of an index fund, such as the S&amp;P
500, is to give investors a diversified selection of securities in one
easy, low-cost investment. It does not require much time, effort, and
lowers risk dramatically because the chances of 500 companies crashing
is a lot lower than a single company going bankrupt.</p>
